// Exercise 1: Calculate the Sum of Two Numbers

a + b = c

num1 + num2 = sum
print sum

ask for 2 numbers 
add the 2 number together 
print on the screen the sum of those 2 numbers


// Exercise 2: Check if a Number is Even or Odd

Input the number (num)
If num mod 2 equals 0 then
Print "num is Even"
Else
Print "num is Odd"
End

// Exercise 3: 
Write pseudo code that will perform the following.    

a) Read in 5 separate numbers.   
b) Calculate the average of the five numbers.
c) Find the smallest (minimum) and largest (maximum) of the five entered numbers.
d) Write out the results found from steps b and c with a message describing what they are

Initialize an empty list called numbers
For i from 1 to 5
Prompt the user to enter a number and call it num
Read num
Append num to the list numbers
End For
Initialize sum as 0
For each number in numbers
Add number to sum
End For
Calculate average as sum divided by 5
Initialize min as the first element of numbers
Initialize max as the first element of numbers
For each number in numbers
If number is less than min
Set min to number
If number is greater than max
Set max to number
End For
Write "The average of the numbers is: " followed by average
Write "The smallest number is: " followed by min
Write "The largest number is: " followed by max
